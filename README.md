# WaterWatcher

WaterWatcher is a data management solution which is used to manage and collect data from buoys that have been deployed to waterways throughout South-East Queensland and other regions throughout the world. It was created as a team project for UQ's 2015 Technology Showcase competition, which it won.

WaterWatcher has 3 main components:
- Server  
- Web App  
- iOS App  

*This repo contains only the iOS app portion of WaterWatcher, which I'm releasing as open source. The other code was the responsibility of other team members who I don't have contact with at this point in time.*


## iOS App

1. You will need a machine running OSX and Xcode 7.0 or greater.
2. Simply import the project. You can compile the given code for simulators out of the box.
3. To load the program onto a device, first plug it in with USB and then wait for Xcode to finish generating indices for it. Once complete, press run and say 'yes' to all dialogs which pop up about signing identities. (This step requires an Apple ID)  If any errors arise with security, try allowing yourself as a developer on your phone under Settings->General->Profile.
